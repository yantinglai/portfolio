1.What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
Time management was the most challenging part, since I also had another part time job that would take me lots of time, so the time I can dedicate to this project is very limited. I find it really simple to work with HTML and CSS. The assignment took me about 2 or 3 days to finish for the first very very sketchy version, and I would say there’s still lots of room for improvement! 

2.What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
I learned from Youtube on how to create a mobile friendly website using CSS and HTML, and in fact didn’t leverage too much on the @media element.

3.What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?
I like the font that I chose and also I kept the website as minimum as possible, each page only tells one story, convey one core message.

4.Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
I will want to add a chatbot function where the visitors and simultaneously engage with me. And I also want to know how to connect the website to my email so that I can really have somebody book my services.

5.How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I spent about 10-15 hours on the assignment, and I wish I could have started earlier, so I can get the extra credit.
